A drag is a pinch with one finger
Touch need to account for border of canvas?
should preventdefault on all touch events?
Maybe need to kill workers to increase responsiveness to touch on mobile with "default" settings
When first open site on Pixel, image height is too large; then resizes as soon as you touch anything
Safari doesn't handle negative numbers properly in drawImage
Polyfill for drawImage generalized to handle non-0 target left and top?
Safari 15 on macOS doesn't show zoom animation when shft-double-clicking
Double-tap not working ios - zooms to wrong place, then partially draws (sometimes), never completes, says First pass... but no rps
Pinch zoom check id's what happens when lift a finger, etc
Why is status ''
Undo zoom is wrong if change window size between zoom and undo zoom
re-eval 2nd pass not drawing until complete.  less clear than orig?

Mul not needing to be a trait bound?
Fix up dependencies in Cargo.toml, and check .gitignore
UCArray stuff
Keep JS worker?
///stuff

    Fit window at 4:3 ratio
    select from examples, uncheck 2nd pass, 800x600, check 2nd pass - nothing happens
    select from examples, uncheck 2nd pass, 800x600, undo, redo, check 2nd pass - completed 792 of 601 rows
        792 is the height when it is fit window
>why does zoom require rescaling while xlate does not?
>0.05 on the dontClear check?
>this code should use canvas instead of imagediv?
    let imagedivStyle = document.querySelector('#imagediv').style;
    imagedivStyle.width = w + "px";
>Look at #imagediv px stuff - use canvas? trying now... Chrome was acting weird... now seems ok... should retry imagediv again
>Drag not working when add another finger then release first finger
>Two-finger tap to zoom out?
>re-eval whether to not redraw on image smaller but same aspect ratio
>doDraw and dontClear logic
>need normalcanvas?
>Undo Move for touch move doesn't translate image first
>Zoom out too fast and it hangs
>check tooltip position calculations
>image too small when window maximised, check width calcs and vw width
>pinch in (zoom out) leaves an undo that says zoom in
>If check 2nd pass sometime after 1st pass, rows/sec is wrong

>"show XML" section is expanding with image

>zoom in a lot, moves image up vertically
>in Dockerfile chmod instead of chown
