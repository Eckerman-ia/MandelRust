# Mandelbrot for Kubernetes
Uses a Kubernetes cluster to compute the Mandelbrot set. 

This repo contains David Eck's original client-side JavaScript version (with a few modifications) in [math.hws.edu](math.hws.edu), and a Kubernetes client/server version in [mb-kubernetes](mb-kubernetes).  The server is written in Rust for a big speed improvement over the original.
